Programming Assignment for Week 2 of ITCS 2350

This program is simple and takes in 3 values of different types (a string, an integer, and a double) to find out how many birds they saw on average per hour.

The program asks for the user's first name.
The program then asks for how many hours the user went birding this week.
Lastly, the program asks for how many birds the user saw while biring this week.

After getting the data, the program calculates the average amount of birds the user saw per hour.

The data is then formatted to be in a table with minimal stylish flair.
The table that is created is also exported to a text file called "report.txt".
